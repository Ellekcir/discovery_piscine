            A little seed<br>
            For me to sow…
            <br><br>
            A little earth<br>
            To make it grow…<br>
            A little hole,<br>
            A little pat…<br>
            A little wish,<br>
            And that is that.<br>
            <br>
            A little sun,<br><br>
            A little shower…<br>
            A little while,<br>
            And then – a flower!</p>

        <p class="text">Nothing Gold Can Stay
            <br>Robert Frost
            <br><br>Nature's first green is gold,<br>
            Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
            Her early leaf's a flower;<br>
            But only so an hour.<br>
            Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>
            So Eden sank to grief,<br>
            So dawn goes down to day.<br>
            Nothing gold can stay.</p>

        <p class="text">Fireflies in the Garden<br>
            Robert Frost<br><br>
            Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,<br>
            And here on earth come emulating flies,<br>
            That though they never equal stars in size,<br>
            (And they were never really stars at heart)<br>
            Achieve at times a very star-like start.<br>
            Only, of course, they can’t sustain the part.</p>
